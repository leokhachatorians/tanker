### What is this?
This is a work in progress to learn more about pathfinding/terrain generation algorithms through a simple shoot-em game written in ncurses.
Not the 'work in progress'. Chances are that there's potentially a lot of things which are buggy, breaking, don't work, or not even implemented yet.

##

### Building
* ```sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev```
* ```make```
* ```./play```

##

### How to play (I use 'play' loosely here)
* Arrow keys to move in a direction
* Spacebar to shoot
